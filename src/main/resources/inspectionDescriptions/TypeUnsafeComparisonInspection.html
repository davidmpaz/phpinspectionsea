Analyzes comparison operators. If '... == ...', '... != ...' (equality) constructions are used,
type-enforcing identical operators are suggested instead ('... === ...', '... !== ...').<br />

additional development and legacy code reverse engineering, so 
the cost-benefit should be weighed carefully.
