Analyzes usages of 'array_search(..)' and 'in_array(...)'. If the 'strict' (third) parameter is missing,
refactoring will be proposed for security's sake.<br />
<br />
Refactoring this might present a significant cost in terms of 
additional development and legacy code reverse engineering, so 
the cost-benefit should be weighed carefully.
